            Hello everyone, In this part of the website, I will tell you my learnings that I have learnt Till now, so let's start.
            </p>
            <h2>In school</h2>
            <p>This is where I've learnt most of the things. I study in Amity international school since I was in Kinder Garden (KG), So if at some
                point I leave this school, I will miss it. Things I have learnt in my school are, culture of states, maths, 
                different types of houses, english, so much about space, how to manage our time, how to build self esteem, powerpoint, excel, e.t.c .
                I have made so many friends in my school, there are so many teachers I like, some memories and everything. Teachers also do so much hard-work to teach 
                us things, so I'll never forget anything.
            </p>
            <h2>Learning that Parents have taught to me</h2>
            <p>My mom was a math teacher, so she knows everything I need and teaches me perfectly. Sometimes, My father helps me in science.
               And mainly,my parents have taught me to behave nicely, do everything on time, value of time, manners and many more thins that I cannot
               count. Before my teachers taught me anything, my parents helped me with everything first, so that's why teachers are not more to 
               me than my parents. Everything I've learnt before my teachers came in, was taught to me by my parents. walking, talking, some rhymes and many
               more. So, I respect my parents very much.
            </p>
