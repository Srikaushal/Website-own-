            <p>Hello everyone, In this part of my website, I will tell you all about my family members, so let's begin.</p>
            <h3>Maternal side</h3>
            <p>In my maternal side, I have 3 cousins. My mom has 3 sisters, I is older than her and 1 is younger than her. The oldest kid in my maternal
                side is my elder brothe, he is 15 years old. The smallest is my cousin sister who is just 3 years old. The second oldest is my brother Mukunda.
                After that it's me, I am the 3rd oldest. The 2nd smallest is is my cousin sister, Dhruthi, and the smallest is dhruvi. My mom is the middle child
                in my maternal side. The sister elder than my mom's name is Vishnu and the younger sister's name is Poori. We came to hyderad bad once in the years
                2021(august) we lived there, for 15 day there and we had so much fun. Everyone gathere in my maternal grandmother's house, everyone in maternal
                family was there, my dad had work, he didn't have work from hom, so he just came for his birthday and he left in 2-3 days.
            </p>
            <h3>Paternal side</h3>
            <p>In the paternal side, the scenario is completely different, I am the smallest in the paternal side. I have 4 cousins in the paternal side.
                My father has 1 brother and one sister, he is the smallest one, the brother is the eldest, and his sister is in the middle. I have 2 cousin sisters
                and 2 cousin brothers, botha re in college, the eldest one is in london, he is studying there. My elder sibling(Koushik) is the second smallest everyone in 
                my paternal side lives in hyderabad, but in my maternal side, I live in Delhi my mom's younger sis lives in america and the elder one lives in 
                Chennai. But no matter it's maternal or Paternal, Ilove my family.
